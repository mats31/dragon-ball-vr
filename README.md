===================

You should not put the VR between my hands... Let's see how three.js, webvr and my iPhone can make us Super Saiyajins !

After cloning install all dependencies :
```bash
npm i
```

## Task
### Start development
It starts a developement server with live reload.
```bash
npm start
```

You are good to go !
